# Poor Story

If you ever see a backlog that has stories like the following, use the [good story](good-story.md) section to write out

**Title:**  
uptime metric  
**Description:**  
AS A user  
I want to see the uptime for a product  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
• go to page and see product uptime metric on dashboard  
• User can click on a button to generate report  
**Artifact:**  
Go ask Andrew or Janice for the mockup

**WHY IS THIS BAD:**

* Title could mean many many things
* What user? It does not feel like anyone is actually effected by this story
* When does the story end? How do you even start it?
* Why does the user want this?
* Acceptance criteria conveys that this might be multiple stories
* No resources, work from the PM still needs to be done
