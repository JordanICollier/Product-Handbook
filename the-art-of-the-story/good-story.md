# Good Story

The following is a story that you would expect to see in a backlog that I would manage:  
  
**Title:**  
Metric Dashboard: Stakeholder wants to view the metrics for the week  
**Description:**  
AS A Stakeholder  
I WANT to be able to view the uptime metrics on a dashboard for a product  
SO THAT I can determine whether we are losing any money due to downtime  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
GIVEN I visit the dashboard related to a product  
When I click on "View all metrics"

**Artifact:**  
Attached is the .jpg of the format I need it in  
  
**WHY IS THIS GOOD:  
•** Can be understood what this does at a high level without opening the story up based on the title  
• Who the user is. Incredibly important, when demos or conversation need to happen. It also instills empathy into what is being built. At the end of the day we need constant reminders that we are dealing with humans.  
• Acceptance is in complete correlation with the users needs  
• Resources are readily available and all in one place  
• Not too big and simple to grasp
