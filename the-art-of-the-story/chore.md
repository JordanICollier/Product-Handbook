# Chore

• **A chore is something that does not add value to a user or move the needle when it comes to confirming the hypothesis  
• Sometimes referred to as technical debt.  
• We "can" still point these if needed, but hopefully all should be a 1 due to realizing the reaction of an earlier implementation  
• These are not new features**
