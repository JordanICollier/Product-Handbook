# Hypothesis

**What is a hypothesis?**  
A guardrail and a statement which directs the product's direction during implementation of a solution, and  measuring.  
  
**When should I have one?**  
If a product exists, we believe it has a hypothesis. Even a product that is is fully automated and has no need for new features still has a relevant hypothesis as it is accomplishing something.  
  
**How do I create a hypothesis?**  
In order to scope out the hypothesis, it is recommended you begin with Product [scoping](scoping.md).   
****  
**What is the format you use to generate a hypothesis?**
