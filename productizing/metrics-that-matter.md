# Metrics that matter

**When I say metrics that matter, I am referring to metrics that correlate to the hypothesis defined.**   
This means several things:  
**1\)** It ensures that the metrics we are watching and displaying are actually valuable  
**2\)** It helps keep us accountable to the metrics defined, over time metrics can get stale and may need to be changed  
**3\)** It reminds us to not bloat the product with too many measurement  
- I usually try and keep my metrics that matter between 1-3, no more  
  
**What do we use the metrics for persevering or pivoting:**  
At a high level, metrics are used to help us determine whether our hypothesis is doing what we expected. If the metrics start to show otherwise we may need to pivot, and rescope the problem we are wanting to solve. If the metrics are moving in a direction that supports our hypothesis, then we will continue to persevere in that direction.
