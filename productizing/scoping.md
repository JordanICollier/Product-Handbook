# Scoping

**What is a scoping:**  
A Scoping is a conversation with a facilitator revolving around a potential or existing product including a set of identified communicators related to the product. To break this down further, it is a conversation that ensures shared understanding and calibration with the direction of a product with all parties involved.  
  
**When do you have a scoping?**

* When you have delivered a hypothesis and ready for the next or 
* Whenever an existing or potential product is identified. 
* An idea is had about a problem/solution
* Work is being done, but it is disorganized
* One thing to note is that it is never too late to have a scoping, you can have a scoping on products that are decades old or even on an idea with no working software/system. What is most important is that you have a scoping, every body involved on a team should be able to recite what a scoping seeks to find out.

**What do you need to run a scoping?**  
**Who:** 1-2 Developer\(s\), Designer, Product Manager of the potential product, stakeholder, user\* and a scoping facilitator  
**How long:** 1 hour or less  
**Goal:** Ensure shared understanding amongst the parties involved. Begin to define the potential ****problem, and why the business should care.  
**Approach:** Below is a PDF that contains an agenda I have put together to begin to identify a product.  
**Antigoal \(What scoping is not\):** Creation of the solution to start delivering code the next day  
  
****_**\*** A user is great to have if enough is known about the product, sometimes more work needs to be done before you can pull them in due to not knowing if they exist yet.  
  
****\*\*Potential is key here, as you do more discovery and framing you can find that the problem originally defined may change or may not be a problem at all_  
  
**Facilitating a scoping takes time to learn, and the more you are a part of the more you can start learning about what are good patterns or signs of out of scope work.**
