# General Questions

**How do I go through this Handbook?**  
The recommendation is to go through it all. Realizing what this book has to offer content-wise, will help spark a thought whenever you find yourself in a place where you are not sure where to move forward or how to approach organization of work/thoughts, interviews, or ensuring direction.  
  
**What if I want to do something different or another method is working well for our team?**  
If you find that variants are working well for you and your team, keep doing them. This handbook provides a guideline to follow or a place to start for better organization. What is highly encouraged, though, is that whatever is chosen that everyone you interact with understands the terms you use. Don't waste time trying to be  perfect, instead seek for consistency. empathy, and a shared understanding. The methods in this book have been proven to work in the top 5 fortune 500 enterprises, midsized companies, startups, or even personal projects.

**We have never referred to what you are saying as...**  
The more you work with different teams you will realize that semantics can mean different things for different teams i.e. what is a product owner vs a product manager, what is an epic/feature/story, how long is an iteration. REMEMBER true agile is not a set of rules, but rather a way to work so that we can adjust to people's needs and having conversations. Like with every workflow we need to ensure we are not being dogmatic, especially if something is just not working for our team.  
  
**Difference between Product Owner and a Product Manager and a Scrum Master?**   
There are many different articles that written wonderfully on this topic that I will not get into here.  
For the sake of this handbook we combine all of the above and say the Product Manager does it all in regard to the following: product backlog, gathering feedback from users, and running ceremonies.  
  
**A marathon, not a sprint**  
You will notice that the theme in this handbook is a week at a time. It is not meant to be a hard and fast rule but further display a sense of urgency to ensure what is being created/curated/maintained is valuable and not stale information.   
  
**It seems so simple**  
Perfect, that is what I like to hear  
  
**It seems so complicated, or I have questions:**  
Reach out to jordanicollier@gmail.com and I can answer any questions, and try and simplify it for yourself and this book. I run this handbook like a product.
