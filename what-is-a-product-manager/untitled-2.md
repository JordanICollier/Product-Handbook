# Day in the Life

**Daily Product Managers will:**  
• Ensure you have a [Hypothesis](../productizing/hypothesis.md), and [metrics](../productizing/metrics-that-matter.md) that reflect the work is being done, and prioritize the work being done  
• Attempt to stay a few iterations ahead with work to be done. If you are finding you are running out of work to do, there is a chance that you need to have another conversation with the user and stakeholder.  
• Be highly available for team queries, you need to be ready to constantly communicate to and from your fellow developers, users, stakeholders, and everyone in between.  
• If you have a designer, ensure you are constantly meeting with them to ensure the design is reflected in the stories.  
• Accept stories that are ready for review QUICKLY. This is to ensure that if changes need be made, they can done so without potentially prohibiting progress on other stories. Also ensure that if stories are ready to be accepted that the new features can be pushed to the users asap. The faster a completed story moves to a user the faster you can get feedback  
• Run daily/weekly ceremonies \(Standups, pre/ipm, retro\)  
• Check the metrics and hypothesis daily  
• Organize the backlog
