# Week in the Life

**Weekly Product Managers will:**  
**Meet with users to interview and gather feedback**  
- ****Do not wait for a user to reach out to you, rather continually go out and gather information  
  
**Pre-IPM \(Iteration Planning Meeting\)**  
1x per week, Product Team and a team representative will meet to ensure there are stories to point for the IPM  
  
**IPM \(Iteration Planning Meeting\)**  
1x per week, Entire team will attend and point stories and ensure there is enough work for the week

**Retro**  
1x a week, A place for the team to discuss what went well, and what could be improved

**Demo**  
1x a week, showing users and stakes holders the progress being made on their product so that we can keep a shared understanding, tighten feedback loops, and have a place for everyone to interact in a controlled and timed environment  
  
NOTE: This is what works best for the teams and companies I have lead, there is no hard and fast rule. This is a reminder that all of the content in this handbook is not a rule yet standards that have helped us with consistency and draw out conversation for better shared understanding and shared empathy.
