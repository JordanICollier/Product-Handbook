# Product Handbook ReadMe
 **What is in this handbook?**

This hand book does 2 major things: teaches you how to turn your ideas into products, and teaches you about the role of a product manager.
The beginning is teaching you how to ensure you are maintaining a clear direction, conducting interviews for feedback, and being the ultimate communicator between the business, user, and team(s) who are implementing the product. The other half focuses on how to conduct ceremonies to instill shared understanding which will could eventually drive a product to be iterated on which you can manage as a product manager.
