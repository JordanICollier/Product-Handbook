# Standups

Every day a standup should take place to ensure the team is calibrated. 

People are incredibly forgetful, and repeating the vision, direction, and what is being worked on needs to be stated often.  
  
**Who:** Entire technical team, designer, and stakeholder\(optional\)  
**How long:** &lt;10 minutes   
**Focus on the following:**

1. **Are there any blockers? -** What conversation can be had to mitigate them
2. **What was done since the last time we met?**
3. **What will your focus today be?** This ensures that work is not duplicated. There are few things more painful than work being delivered twice. [ **Retro Items**](../ceremonies/untitled.md) ****Ensure you are bringing up the Action Items generated from your own team's retro until they are solved **Make sure blockers are understood by yourself, and that you or someone can unblock it as soon as possible.** Remind everyone of any upcoming demo's or ceremonies, the scope of the product\*

_\*Overtime teams can tend to take on more and more, and it is up to you to ensure what is being talked about is in relation to the current hypothesis and goals_
