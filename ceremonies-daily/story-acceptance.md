# Story Acceptance

Some folks set specific times in a day to accept stories, but I always encourage to review them as the Product Manager with the deliverer as soon as they are ready to be reviewed  
  
**ACCEPTANCE IS A PAIRING EFFORT**  
_"A story is a reminder to have a conversation"_  
When it comes to accepting stories we need to make sure that the PM is involved. Meet with the developer who delivered the story, and pair with them. Make sure that the story meets the expectation of the story that was written.  
  
**Who:** Product Manager and the person who delivered the story  
**How long:** as long as is needed to review the story and it's acceptance criteria   
**Focus on the following:**  
**Does this do exactly what the story was asking for in the acceptance criteria?**  
-If not, send it back to be worked and clarify what was discussed  
-If not but it accomplishes something else that is needed, write another story that captures the work done     
 and review with the entire team. Send back the original story  
-If so, then accept it so that other stories can be worked on

Tip:  
I suggest accepting stories as soon as they are delivered. Turn on notifications on your platform and react to them quickly.
