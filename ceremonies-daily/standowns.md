# Standowns\*

Same as Standup but at the end of the day, can be important when handing off work for the day to another team globally

Can be important to have when small changes have major impacts to Users and you need to constantly check vitals  
  
Also be used when working with a globally distributed team, and needing to hand over work to another team for the day.  
  
\*Many times I have found standowns are not needed, but when they are needed they can be the key ingredient into ensuring shared understanding on something complex.
