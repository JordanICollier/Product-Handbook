# Overview

**Why have meetings every week:**

  
**It all comes down to shared understanding. All of these ceremonies have to do with ensuring that everyone is aligned with what needs to be done, and what role each person has on the team.**  
  
_Tip:  
With all of these, ensure that someone is assigned as the time-referee. The time-referee is someone who writes something down that needs to be talked about a later time and cuts conversations short, that are out of scope or detracting from the original meeting_
