# Pre-Iteration Planning Meeting \(Pre-IPM\)

**Who:** 1 Developer, Designer, Product Manager  
**How long:** 1 hour or less  
**Facilitator:** Product Manager  
**Goal:** Communicate the upcoming direction from the Product Manager\*\* and stakeholder for the upcoming IPM.   
  
**Key Points of Focus:**

* Wordsmith the stories in a way that the rest of the team may understand.
* Ensure stories are fleshed out and ready to be worked on for the next week.
* Prioritize based off of feedback, user needs, and highest value that can be achieved quickly if possible.
* Attach any designs or artifacts to stories that need referenceable context.
* Do anything here that wouldn't take away time from the team during the IPM \(Iteration Planning Meeting\), as this is a great time to discuss with a developer to clear up any technical questions you may have.

**\*\* \(TBD\) - Need to expand**
