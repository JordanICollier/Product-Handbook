# Demo Day

**Presenter:** 1 developer \(rotate\), PM  
**Attendees:** Any user, or stakeholder or anyone else who could receive value  
**How long:** 5-10 minutes per product  
**Facilitator:** A Demo MC, each Product Manager and a developer from each team  
**Goal as a Product Manager:**

1. Show what is currently being built by each team 
2. Quick demos from each team showing what has changed since the last demo - What is the current hypothesis being tested - The metrics attached the products - Show any new functionality, and display feedback
3. Q&A with the Product Managers and Developers - This is a great time to ask questions as a user/consumer and stakeholder 

**Tips:**  
_Try and pre-record your demo for a myriad of reasons:  
- Ensures you end on time, which in turn ensures you have time for Q&A  
- Can be played on multiple machines in case your demo environment or own machine goes down  
- Can be shared with folks not in the demo  
- Ensure you show the product as intended without other technical interferences_
