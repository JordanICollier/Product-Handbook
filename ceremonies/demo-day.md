# Demo Day

**Presenter:** 1 developer \(rotate\), PM  
**Attendees:** Any user, or stakeholder or anyone else who could receive value  
**How long:** 5-10 minutes per product  
**Facilitator:** A Demo MC, each Product Manager and a developer from each team  
**Goal as a Product Manager:**  
1\) Show what is currently being built by each team on the Platform Team  
2\) Quick demos from each team showing what has changed since the last demo  
- What is the current hypothesis being tested  
- The metrics attached the products  
- Show any new functionality, and display feedback  
3\) QandA with the Product Managers and Developers  
- This is a great time to ask questions as a user/consumer and stakeholder  
  
**Tip:**  
Try and prerecord your demo for a myriad of reasons:  
- Ensures you end on time, which in turn ensures you have time for QandA  
- Can be played on multiple machines in case your demo environment or own machine goes down  
- Can be shared with folks not in the demo  
- Ensure you show the product as intended without other technical interferences
